# Deep Learning Server Environment Setup
This file contains detailed configuration on how to setup environment on the Deep Learning server.

**Directories**

All required packages and shared files are under /opt/, which includes

- /opt/anaconda/

  -/opt/anaconda/anaconda2/: Anaconda python 2.7 
  
  -/opt/anaconda/anaconda3/: Anaconda python 3.6
  
- /opt/code/: Segmentation code on git.cs.vt.edu

- /opt/wordembedding/: Pre-trained GloVe and word2vec

- /opt/stanfordnlp/: Stanford NLP package

- /opt/cudnn/: cudnn6.0 and cudnn 7.1 files


**Python and CUDA Setup**

- CUDA-8.0 (cudnn 6.0) and CUDA-9.0 (cudnn 7.1) have been installed under /usr/local/. 

- PyTorch (0.3.1) and Tensorflow (r1.7) in Python 2.7 built with CUDA-9.0 (cudnn 7.1).

- PyTorch (0.3.1) and Tensorflow (r1.4) in Python 3.6 built with CUDA-8.0 (cudnn 6.0).

In order to enable these packages, you can setup environment variables in ~/.bashrc.

By default, I've activated Python 3.6 and CUDA-8.0. To use Python 2.7 and CUDA-9.0, run the following
commands in your terminal after you login:

``` bash
# enable cuda-9.0
echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-9.0/bin:$PATH' Â» ~/.bashrc
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-9.0/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
# enbale python 2.7
echo 'export PATH=/opt/anaconda/anaconda2/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Also you'll need to setup CORENLP variable for python version of Stanford NLP:

``` bash
# Python Stanford NLP environment variable CORENLP
echo 'export CORENLP_HOME=/opt/stanfordnlp/stanford-corenlp-full-2018-02-27/' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Enjoy!
